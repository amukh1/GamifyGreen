# Gamify Green

### About the app
Gamify Green is a part of the evolving idea of 'gamifying' your life---that is, to make your life seem like a game, complete with achievements, goals, and more.
Players will use this app to track how they are contributing to the 'green' of the society by checking off suggestions that will appear on their home page.
As they complete more and more tasks, their point amount will go up, motivating them to do even more for the environment.

### Why we made the app
We wanted people to be more aware of the rising problems in society, so we decided to do something about it. In order to do that, we made this app so that people would feel motivated by their 'green' actions. We hope that when they see that what they are doing is contributing to their points on the leaderboard, they will want to compete even more in order to become the number one 'greener'.

### Builds
We currently have two versions of the source code: a master version, which is the stable version of the app, and a dev version, which will get frequent updates, and as a result, will be somewhat unstable. Use at your own risk.

### Frequently asked questions
#### Is the app paid?
No, it is completely free, with no in-app purchases ever.

#### Are there ads?
No, there are no ads on our app. We wish to give you the best in-app experience, and with ads, well, we can't really call it the best, can we?
